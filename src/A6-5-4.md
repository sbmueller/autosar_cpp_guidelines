> For-init-statement and expression should not perform actions other than
> loop-counter initialization and modification.

## Rationale

If only a loop-counter is used in the for-init-statement and expression, it increases
readability and it is easier to understand and maintain code.

## Example

```cpp
// $Id: A6-5-4.cpp 305629 2018-01-29 13:29:25Z piotr.serwa $
#include <cstdint>

void Fn() noexcept
{
    for (std::int32_t x = 0, MAX = 10; x < MAX; x++) // compliant with A6-5-2, but
                                                     // non-compliant with advisory A6-5-4
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```
