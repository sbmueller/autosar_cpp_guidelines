## Rationale

It is expected behavior that the move/copy constructors are only used to move/copy
the object of the class type and possibly set moved-from object to a valid state.
Move and copy constructors of an object are frequently called by STL algorithms and
containers, so they are not supposed to provide any performance overhead or side
effects that could affect moving or copying the object.
Note: Class members that are not essential for a class invariant may not need to be
copied (e.g. caches, debug information).

## Example

```cpp
// $Id: A12-8-1.cpp 303582 2018-01-11 13:42:56Z michal.szczepankiewicz $
#include <cstdint>
#include <utility>
class A
{
public:
    // Implementation
    A(A const& oth) : x(oth.x) // Compliant
    {
    }

private:
    std::int32_t x;
};
class B
{
public:
    // Implementation
    B(B&& oth) : ptr(std::move(oth.ptr)) // Compliant
    {
        oth.ptr = nullptr; // Compliant - this is not a side-effect, in this
                           // case it is essential to leave moved-from object
                           // in a valid state, otherwise double deletion will
                           // occur.
    }
    ~B() { delete ptr; }

private:
    std::int32_t* ptr;
};
class C
{
public:
    // Implementation
    C(C const& oth) : x(oth.x)
    {
        // ...
        x = x % 2; // Non-compliant - unrelated side-effect
    }

private:
    std::int32_t x;
};

class D
{
public:
    explicit D(std::uint32_t a) : a(a), noOfModifications(0) {}
    D(const D& d) : D(d.a) {} // compliant, not copying the debug information
                              // about number of modifications
    void SetA(std::uint32_t aa)
    {
        ++noOfModifications;
        a = aa;
    }
    std::uint32_t GetA() const noexcept
    {
        return a;
    }

private:
    std::uint32_t a;
    std::uint64_t noOfModifications;
};
