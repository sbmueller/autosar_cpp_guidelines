## Rationale

Known as a DU dataflow anomaly, this is a process whereby there is a data flow in which
a variable is given a value that is not subsequently used. At best this is inefficient,

but may indicate a genuine problem. Often the presence of these constructs is due to
the wrong choice of statement aggregates such as loops.
See: DU-Anomaly.

## Exception

Loop control variables (see Section 6.6.5) are exempt from this rule.

## Example

```cpp

#include <array>
#include <cstdint>
std::uint8_t Fn1(std::uint8_t param) noexcept
{
std::int32_t x{
0}; // Non-compliant - DU data flow anomaly; Variable defined,
// but not used
if (param > 0)
{
return 1;
}
else
{
return 0;
}
}
std::int32_t Fn2() noexcept
{
std::int8_t x{10U}; // Compliant - variable defined and will be used
std::int8_t y{20U}; // Compliant - variable defined and will be used
std::int16_t result = x + y; // x and y variables used

x = 0; // Non-compliant - DU data flow anomaly; Variable defined, but x is
// not subsequently used and goes out of scope
y = 0; // Non-compliant - DU data flow anomaly; Variable defined, but y is
// not subsequently used and goes out of scope
return result;
}
std::int32_t Fn3(std::int32_t param) noexcept
{
std::int32_t x{param +
1}; // Compliant - variable defined, and will be used in
// one of the branches
// However, scope of x
variable could be reduced
if (param > 20)
{
return x;
}
return 0;
}
std::int32_t Fn4(std::int32_t param) noexcept

{
std::int32_t x{param +

1}; // Compliant // some of the

defined, and will be used in

if (param > 20)
{
return x + 1;
}
else if (param > 10)
{
return x;
}

return 0;

void Fn5() noexcept
{
std::array<std::int32_t, 100> arr{};
arr.fill(1);

constexpr std::uint8_t limit{100U};
std::int8_t x{0};
for (std::uint8_t i{0U}; i < limit; ++i) // Compliant by exception - on the
// final loop, value of i defined will
// not be used
{
arr[i] = arr[x];
