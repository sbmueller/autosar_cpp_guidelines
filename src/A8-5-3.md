> A variable of type auto shall not be initialized using {} or

## Rationale

If an initializer of a variable of type auto is enclosed in braces, then the result of type
deduction may lead to developer confusion, as the variable initialized using {} or ={}
will always be of std::initializer_list type.
Note that some compilers, e.g. GCC or Clang, can implement this differently initializing a variable of type auto using {} will deduce an integer type, and initializing
using ={} will deduce a std::initializer_list type. This is desirable type deduction which
will be introduced into the C++ Language Standard with C++17.

## Example

```cpp
// $Id: A8-5-3.cpp 289436 2017-10-04 10:45:23Z michal.szczepankiewicz $
#include <cstdint>
#include <initializer_list>
void Fn() noexcept
{
auto x1(10); // Compliant - the auto-declared variable is of type int, but
// not compliant
with A8-5-2.
auto x2{10};
// Non-compliant
- according
to C++14 standard the
// auto-declared
variable
is
of type std::initializer_list.
// However, it can
behave
differently on different
compilers.
auto x3 = 10; // Compliant - the auto-declared variable is of type int, but
// non-compliant with A8-5-2.
auto x4 = {10}; // Non-compliant - the auto-declared variable is of type
// std::initializer_list, non-compliant with A8-5-2.
std::int8_t x5{10}; // Compliant
}

```
